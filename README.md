# AOSP Alliance

An alliance on people working on AOSP forks to share resources, and avoid duplicate work.

Chat: IRC Channel [#AOSPAlliance](https://webchat.freenode.net/#AOSPAlliance) on Freenode.

Currently includes:
# 
# [CalyxOS](https://gitlab.com/calyxos)
# [GrapheneOS](https://github.com/grapheneos)
# [#!os (Hashbang OS)](https://github.com/hashbang/os)
# [RattlesnakeOS](https://github.com/RattlesnakeOS)
# [Robotnix](https://github.com/danielfullmer/robotnix)

The aim is to share any repos with the same type of changes, even if we end up making further changes on top.

Examples:
* android-prepare-vendor
* Some apps which need minor fixes, such as Messaging.
* Installer
